# Iterative App - Round 2

## Overview
This is a minimal web page developed iteratively. For Round 2, the page now includes a footer that indicates completion of the round.

## Setup
- No build tools required.
- Open `index.html` directly in any modern web browser.

## Usage
- Open `index.html`.
- Scroll if needed; the footer remains at the bottom of the page.
- You will see the confirmation text in the footer: “Round 2 complete.”

## Improvements from Previous Version (Round 2)
- Added a semantic `<footer>` element to the page.
- Styled the footer to stick to the bottom using a flex column layout and `min-height: 100vh`.
- Provided clear completion text “Round 2 complete.” with accessible, high-contrast styling.
- Kept the page lightweight with inline CSS and no external dependencies.
